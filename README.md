# Soccer Central Web App
Soccer Central is an innovative, data-driven organization that leverages the power of information to unlock the full potential of its academy. With a consistent focus on player development, training strategies, and performance optimization, data is used to drive informed decisions, personalized experiences, and a culture of excellence both on and off the field.

## Project Description
The project led by Soccer Central aims to gain a comprehensive understanding of the physical and tactical performance of academy players participating in the "MLS Next" league, which represents the pinnacle of youth male soccer competition in the United States and features the countryâ€™s top teams and players. To achieve this, the academy has access to a variety of data sources that allow for tracking player and team behaviors and performance. However, the goal is to optimize the analysis and decision-making process in an integrated manner.

## Project Goal
To facilitate the performance analysis of Soccer Central academy players through the creation of a normalized database based on data relevance, along with the use of visualizations and customized reports to support continuous improvement in decision-making among stakeholders, to be developed over a 10-week period.

## Specific Objectives
1. **Data Centralization**: Create a structured database that centralizes all relevant player information, including performance, injuries, body composition, and academic data.
2. **Process Improvement**: Professionalize the use of data by implementing acquisition, control, and audit processes, avoiding the disorganized use of multiple spreadsheets.
3. **Data Analysis**: Conduct in-depth analysis of available data to identify patterns and areas for improvement in player performance.
4. **Report Generation**: Automate the creation of standardized and visual reports (PDF, dashboards), improving communication and enabling quick decision-making across key departments.
5. **Digital Culture**: Promote a digital culture based on advanced tools that streamline processes and support strategic decision-making with reliable data.
6. **Interdepartmental Collaboration**: Strengthen synergy between analysis, methodology, and physical preparation teams to align objectives and maximize sports performance.
7. **Tool Development**: Evaluate and select appropriate technological tools for data analysis and visualization, considering team comfort and user experience.
8. **Results Presentation**: Establish a consistent format and design for presenting results, aligned with the institution's identity.

## Methodology
The methodology used in this study follows a structured approach based on the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining), which has become one of the most effective frameworks for the development and application of data mining projects. This approach is divided into several key phases that guide the process from initial problem understanding to the implementation of data-based solutions.

1. **Business Understanding**: In this phase, the research problem is defined, project goals are set, and the key questions guiding the data analysis are formulated.
2. **Data Understanding**: Here, an initial overview of the characteristics of the data provided by suppliers is obtained, along with an assessment of their advantages and limitations.
3. **Data Preparation**: This stage involves data cleaning, integration, and transformation. Inconsistencies are removed, missing values are handled, and different sources are consolidated to ensure the data is comparable and ready for analysis.
4. **Modeling**: A comparative analysis of the different data providers is conducted using various analytical techniques. Performance metrics are generated, key event distributions are visualized, and meaningful patterns are identified to offer valuable insights for decision-making in soccer.
5. **Evaluation**: The results obtained from the comparative analysis are validated to ensure that the findings are relevant and applicable in the context of soccer performance.
6. **Deployment**: Finally, results are presented using interactive visual tools such as dashboards and graphs to enable clear and accessible understanding of the findings.

## How to Contribute
To contribute, first create a branch that describes the change, e.g., `feature-update-readme`, and then create a *Pull Request* to the `master` branch of this repository.

Ideally, the *Pull Request* description should state if it resolves a numbered issue and include a link to it. If not, it should contain a description of the tests performed for the implementation as well as a textual summary of the change.
